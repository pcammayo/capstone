      <h2>Questions</h2>

        <h3>What was my Capstone?</h3>

          <p>The goal of my capstone was to code a working game as well as a website</p>

        <h3>What are some major challenges that you had creating your project? How did you go about it?</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>Figuring out how to create the Snake game.</li>
            <p>After a week of frustration the one main function that I couldn't figure out how to code was how to increase the snake size after it ate the piece of food. So I ended up scrapping the idea to create Pong.</p>

            <li>Figuring out why my javascript code wasn't working (wouldn't display).</li>
            <p>The reason why my javascript code wasn't working was because it wasn't the same language. On Khan Academy they teach Processing Javascript which has a library that is specific to that version. So I was using Processing Javascript from Khan Academy without knowing I was suppose to refer my javascript file that it was from that specfic version. I figured this out after reading through a bunch of Khan Academy lessons to find out how to make my code work outside of Khan Academy.</p>

            <li>Debugging my code</li>
            <p>After hours on end trying to get my code to work and having to read through it everytime it didn't, I remembered that I could just use Khan Academy to help me figure out what's wrong with my code.</p>
          </ol>
